			Commons Lang Package
			   Version 1.0-b1
			    Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Lang package. 

There is a high demand for the functionality found in Commons Lang in other 
Jakarta projects. Some are already using it, often because they submitted 
the original code, other times because they find the functionality useful,
and other times because they want to release and don't want to depend upon a 
nightly build of Commons Lang.

Therefore this is a beta release of a stable api for these projects and any 
other interested project to depend upon. 

It is important to note that this is not a traditional beta, a piece of 
code thrown out with many bugs remaining. It is a beta because additional 
classes are expected to be added before a full release, but the classes 
contained in this release are not expected to change.
